# Minigrid-extended
Minigrid environments to easily test and study RL algorithms

## What you can do with this package

This toolset is a fork of gym-minigrid (https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid), with a major structural refactoring, and code cleanups:
- Unified structure for all algorithms
- PEP8 compliant (unified code style)
- Documented functions and classes
- More tests & more code coverage
- Additional algorithms: SAC and TD3 (+ HER support for DQN, DDPG, SAC and TD3)
